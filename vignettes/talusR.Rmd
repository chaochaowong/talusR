# Getting started

For now, this package only takes Talus data that are pre-processed by DIANNâ€”i.e. the summarized protein-abundance file (`*.tsv`). The input metadata table (`*.csv`) must include a column (`which_run`) whose entries exactly match the sample (run) names in that abundance file.

This package also assumes that Talus process only one sample in a single run (one mass-spectrometry acquisition), and DIANN has executed the normalization process across all the runs.
