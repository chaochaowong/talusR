# Getting started

For now, this package only takes Talus data that are pre-processed by DIANNâ€”i.e. the summarized protein-abundance file (`*.tsv`). The input metadata table (`*.csv`) must include a column (`which_run`) whose entries exactly match the sample (run) names in that abundance file.

This package also assumes that Talus process only one sample in a single run (one mass-spectrometry acquisition), and DIANN has executed the normalization process across all the runs. 

Install `talusR`:
```{r install-talusR, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('chaochaowong/talusR',
                         ref          = "dev",
                         dependencies = TRUE
)

# or to install the Bioconductor dependencies
BiocManager::install(
  "chaochaowong/talusR@dev",
  dependencies = TRUE
)
```

```{r load-library}
library(talusR)
```

# Import Talus data
